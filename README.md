# College Website Section Redesign (UI/UX Project)


This project was completed after my Master’s final semester, when my professor recognized my **UI/UX design skills** and proposed a real-world project: **redesigning the 'Training and Placement' section of the official college website**.  

*College Name* :- **Finolex Academy of Management & Technology (FAMT), Ratnagiri, Maharashtra - 415639**

My responsibility was to design the **wireframes and interactive prototype** in **Figma**, and then hand over the design to my teammate, who implemented it using frontend technologies. The design was well-received by my professor and went into actual use.

## Tools & Skills
- **Figma** – Wireframing & Prototyping  
- **Design thinking with UI/UX Principles**  
- **Collaboration** – Handing off design to developer for implementation
